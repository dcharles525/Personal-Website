          <h1>Reflections on the Path of a Software Engineer</h1>
          <p>Recently, I was jolted into a moment of reflection: it's been 10 short years since I launched my professional programming career. A dusty old Google Photos snapshot of me grinning in front of a giant company logo suddenly reminded me of those days when I felt like I was conquering the world. Ten years may be pitifully brief—or an eternity, depending on who you ask—and to me, these years have felt like a wild, unpredictable blend of both. In this post, I'll share a few observations on software engineering and life in general—opinions that might make you raise an eyebrow, agree wholeheartedly, or perhaps both. But hey, if nothing else, I hope that in another five or ten years you'll look back on these musings with a knowing smile as the winds of change blow.</p>
          <p>Over Engineering</p>
          <p>My first &quot;application&quot; was a
          calculator for a silly idle XP game—backend in PHP, frontend in
          plain HTML/JS. No fancy frameworks, just raw code. It worked fine and
          only took me a weekend from the idea to the moment it was live on a
          server. That experience hit me later when I bootstrapped a new app
          idea only to realize it ballooned into megabytes of binary bloat
          before I'd even written a line of actual app logic. A little voice in
          my head reminded me, &quot;This was supposed to be a weekend
          project—now you're wrestling with a framework for weeks!&quot; And
          it's not just my projects; countless examples out there show we’ve
          lost our edge when it comes to keeping applications lean. With
          today’s hardware more than capable of handling bloated apps, why
          not aim for efficient, single-purpose, open source software instead?
          We need tools that favor simplicity and push back against anything
          that complicates the process.This also applies to platform
          engineering. If you're setting up a personal website, you likely
          don't need a Kubernetes cluster. This site even is running in a
          Docker container which is probably overkill..</p>
          <p>Ego</p>
          <p>Have you ever scrolled through
          LinkedIn, only to find a post proclaiming, &quot;I'm the greatest,
          and here's why!&quot;—only to later discover the bold claims are
          either exaggerated or flat-out false? This mindset is rampant in the
          tech industry. Everyone aspires to be the next Steve Jobs or Sergey
          Brin, but what happened to simply building cool software because you
          loved the craft—not chasing fame or fortune? When I was heading
          into college, I kept hearing, &quot;Oh yeah, Computer Science is
          where the money is!&quot; and &quot;There are tons of jobs in the
          US!&quot; That hype inevitably attracted people who, frankly, didn’t
          care about the art of coding, and now it shows. Nearly five years out
          of college, aspiring engineers find it tough to land a
          job—entry-level positions are nowhere to be seen because they’re
          being shipped overseas or replaced by so-called &quot;vibe coders&quot;
          and AI assistants. Whether this trend will last is up for debate.</p>
          <p>Languages &amp; Frameworks</p>
          <p>Use the tool that best fits the job.
          Why use a power drill to cut wood or screw in a switch plate? Sure,
          you could—but a saw or screwdriver is a better choice. We need to
          be mindful of our biases. I love Golang, but it’s not the right fit
          for writing an Android app. Heck, this website is built using plain
          HTML/CSS. Could I have used something like React, Astro, or even
          Ember Octane (my favorite)? Sure, but they wouldn't be the right
          tools for this site. For now, simple HTML/CSS does the job just fine.</p>
          <p>Getting Things Done</p>
          <p>I've encountered code that was
          ingeniously engineered—but when I discovered it took five times
          longer than estimated, it became infuriating. Does cranking out
          technically impressive yet overly complex code make sense, even if
          it's not costing you extra on paper? Sometimes, yes; most of the
          time, no. Keep It Simple, Stupid. If your code can't be understood by
          a Junior Engineer or takes way too long to develop than expected
          only, you've missed the mark. Ultimately, programming is about
          getting things done, and this kind of overengineering only hurts your
          teammates and employer.</p>
          <p>Hustle Culture</p>
          <p>This topic is all the rage: work non-stop, code day and night, and
          you'll make it big! But I've got news—that simply isn’t true.
          We're human, after all; you need sleep, exercise, and proper food. If
          you’re glued to your computer while fueling up on Taco Bell and
          sugary drinks, you’re bound to crash eventually. I've learned this
          lesson firsthand, and so have others—some last years on this pace,
          while others burn out in mere months.</p>
          <p>That said, know when to buckle down. If you've messed up code that's
          delaying a deadline, then it's time to grind. And if you're at an
          underfunded, lean startup, expect long hours. Just remember that
          everyone has their limits.</p>
          <p>Wrap Up</p>
          <p>You might be thinking, &quot;Wow, what
          a cynical take on software engineering!&quot; And you’re partially
          right. Over the past year, while job hunting and stepping into the
          real software engineering world, I've been weighed down by these
          issues. But here's the flip side: while I've managed not to pick up
          the negative traits, I did absorb some positive ones along the way.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Be kind to everyone, we’re all
            here just trying to live our lives.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Help others—not just show them
            how to code or complete a task, but teach them how to fish. Don’t
            shy away from saying, “I won’t always be around to help, so let
            me show you how to help yourself.” Some of the most valuable
            skills, like debugging and research, rarely make it into educational
            settings.</p></li>
            <li><p>Never stop doing personal
            projects. Personal projects are things that remind you why you love
            programming. Our industry is kind of unique in this way, where you’d
            come home from a day of programming just to program some more.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><p>Note the nuance here, you don’t
              need a solid green GitHub activity bar! Just always have those
              projects to experiment on.
              </p></li>
            </ul>
            <li><p>Have multiple hobbies, personal
            programming projects are a must, but find other things that make you
            happy. For me I love running, woodworking, and gardening. Some of my
            biggest breakthroughs have been while I did one of these hobbies.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><p>I remember in the early COVID
              days I was working through a coding problem and just couldn’t
              crack it. Went for a run during my lunch break, then came back to
              work on the code and everything just clicked.
              </p></li>
            </ul>
            <li><p>Keep learning new things. It can
            be in programming or anything else. Programmers are wired to be
            curious, so feed your brain!
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Take
            criticism with grace. This was tough for me early on—I used to
            clam up and get defensive, taking feedback as a personal attack.
            Now, when you receive criticism, take a deep breath. Open your editor
            and draft a response, then delete it. Instead, go talk to the person
            or call them to discuss what went wrong, ask questions, reflect, and
            then move on.</p></li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Do the right thing. Programmers
            hold considerable power, which can easily inflate our egos. Stick to
            a strong moral compass, and if you're ever in doubt, get a few
            opinions. While doing the right thing might be inconvenient, it lets
            you rest easy.</p></li>
