            David is a programmer at heart, starting his programming career at age 11 by programming some websites to run
            on the gaming device "PSP". He quickly advanced his skills diving deep into functional languages such as Java,
            C#, and his favorite PHP. As of recently he has been hired at his university (As of Freshman Year) for research into web technologies and
            started his own company along with his brother, which got accepted by the local incubator. In the future David hopes
            to bring inovation to networking security, AI, and philosophical ideas. Check out some of his stuff below!
